      <description>Welcome to the blog!
I&amp;rsquo;m Hugo, my background is in Psychology, more specifically, the area of face perception. Always eager to learn and after falling in love with R, I will blog mostly about data related topics(e.g. importing, wrangling, visualization, statistics). Not yet Machine Learning, I&amp;rsquo;m still learning.
I want to share what I have been learning in R and try to help others to work with it.
I also enjoy other things, non-data related, like history, tvshows, and literature, which I might blog about it.</description>
